# Geo command-line Bootcamp

## Introduction

> todo!

##Â Who is this for?

Anyone who wants to learn to work with geospatial data at the UNIX command-line.

## Prerequisites

You should *already* :

- **know command-line basics**. If you don't, head over to [the command-line bootcamp](rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp) to get up to speed before returning to this bootcamp.
- **be familiar with basic GIS and geospatial concepts**. If you aren't, we recommend following [one of these basic GIS courses](https://www.gislounge.com/learn-gis-for-free/) before returning to this bootcamp.

## How to read this tutorial

Command-line examples that you are meant to type into a terminal window, and the results of those examples, will be shown in a black code block, e.g.

```bash
ls -lrh
```

Sometimes the accompanying text will include a reference to a Unix command. Any such text will also be in a constant-width, boxed font. E.g.

>Type the `pwd` command.

From time to time this documentation will contain [web links][] to pages that will help you find out more about certain Unix commands. Usually, the _first_ mention of a command or function will be a hyperlink to Wikipedia. Important or critical points will be styled like so:

>***This is an important point!***
