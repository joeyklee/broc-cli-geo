## How to read this tutorial

Command-line examples that you are meant to type into a terminal window, and the results of those examples, will be shown in a black code block, e.g.

```bash
ls -lrh
```

Sometimes the accompanying text will include a reference to a Unix command. Any such text will also be in a constant-width, boxed font. E.g.

>Type the `pwd` command.

From time to time this documentation will contain [web links][] to pages that will help you find out more about certain Unix commands. Usually, the _first_ mention of a command or function will be a hyperlink to Wikipedia. Important or critical points will be styled like so:

>***This is an important point!***
