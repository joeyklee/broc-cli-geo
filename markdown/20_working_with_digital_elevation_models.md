# Working with digital elevation models

## about

Digital Elevation Models (DEM) are raster data about topography. DEM's do not include features such as trees and buildings and are therefore different from Digital Surface Models (DSM) which include those features. DEM's are rich sources of data can be used generate hillshades, slope, and relief maps. 

In this module, you will learn a thing or two about working with digital elevation models. We will learn how to:

* Create a hillshade
* Change the hillshade light direction and vertical exaggeration
* Make a colored relief map
* Make a slope map
* Make a contour map
