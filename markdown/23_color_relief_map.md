# Color Relief Map


Color relief or hypsometric tints depict elevation as bands of color, to enhance elevation zones so map readers can better see differences in relief. The colors selected for the tints are assumed to relate to the ground cover typically found at various elevations in the area being mapped. A typical color scheme progresses from dark greens for lower elevations up through yellows/browns, and on to grays and white at the highest elevations - [BjÃ¸rn Sandvik](http://blog.thematicmapping.org/2012/06/creating-color-relief-and-slope-shading.html). 

In order to create color our DEM, we need to create colored breaks for a selected number of elevation bins. First, let's check what the min and max values are using the `gdalinfo` command with the `-stats` flag:

```
gdalinfo sf-dem.tif -stats
```

We should get something like this:

```

    STATISTICS_STDDEV=24.762441881228
```

We can see that: `Min=-2.4` and `Max=126.7`. Using this information we can make some elevation breaks and some corresponding colors for each break. The example below shows how gdal will use apply a color to the pixels with the corresponding elevation.

```
elev1 r g b
elev2 r g b
elev3 r g b
elev4 r g b
...
```

Make a `color-relief.txt` using the `echo` command, like so. In this case, `echo` takes everything between the quotations and stuffs it into a file called `color-relief.txt` usng the `>` operator:

```
echo '0 0 0 0
26 110 220 110
51 240 250 160
76 230 220 170
101 220 220 220
127 250 250 250' > color-relief.txt
```

Now we can generate our colored relief:

```
gdaldem color-relief -of PNG sf-dem.tif color-relief.txt sf-dem-coloredRelief.tif
```
